While that's all well and good for a kid, he's on the cusp of manhood now and things are starting to get complicated. Would he attend university? learn a trade? get slicked into a portal and transported to a magical land? turns out it was the third one. Ah well, maybe an epic adventure is just what Kal needs to figure out his life.`}, daniel: { name: "Daniel Castrillo", properties: { Age: 12, Nationality: "Spanish", Birthday: "October 24", Likes: "Fantasy novels, cooking, quietly observing others.", Dislikes: "Loud noises, danger, being observed by others.", "Blood Type": "O-negative" }, description: "Daniel, a sweet and caring boy, has spent his entire life under the thumb of an uncaring and violent father. Does Pyli represent a new beginning for him? A chance to finally live out his dreams of heroism? Or maybe this new world and its strange perils will be too much.
